# propc
Compiles propositional functions into C

The design philosophy was to do the most meme thing possible, I just wanted to get some experience with C.

- cpc compiles propositional functions in sexp format into shared libraries.
- pfunc just takes arguments and plugs them into a compiled function.
- ttable prints a full truth table of a propositional function

One day I will go back and add
- The ability for variable names to be arbitrary strings
- Improved interface programs, like a comparison program
- Prettier printing in ttable
